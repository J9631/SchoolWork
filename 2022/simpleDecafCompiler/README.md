# Decaf Compiler 2022
This code is a simple compiler for a Decaf program containing functionality up to while loops and simple recursion.

The entire compiler has been coded in C while also utilizing LEX and YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler)

In order to use this compiler:
1.) download all of the files into a single directory.
2.) Either manually create an executable or use the makefile.
3.) Execute the makefile using input redirection from a simple decaf program in a text file.
