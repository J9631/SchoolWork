# Decaf Compiler 2022
This code is a simple compiler for a Decaf program containing functionality up to while loops and simple recursion.

The entire compiler has been coded in C while also utilizing LEX and YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler)

In order to use this compiler, download all of the files into a single directory and use the makefile from the command line alongside a 
text file containing DECAF code to create an executable.
